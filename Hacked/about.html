    <center><p> I hope you like my website this is a basic project showing my current knowledge and skills in HTML.
        There was some information about me in the home page. So I will tell you how I spent my winter break.
        Over winter break I did a variety of things such as starting a new job, traveling, and spending time with my family and friends. I began the break by getting a new job at JP Morgan and Chase as an associate banker. Right after finals, I applied and attended an interview, getting hired within a number of days. To my surprise I got the job fairly quickly and spent the first two weeks of my break training for 40 hours a week. During this time, I was able to learn a vast amount of information and various responsibilities pertaining to banking. Immediately after the training period I began working at the main branch which is only miles away from my house. Due to my knowledge and skill set in computer science they assigned me to a new trending hybrid branch, a new innovation which they are implementing nationwide. A hybrid branch is a particular branch which focuses on training and utilizing Atm’s and computers rather than the traditional branches teller lines. I was given the task of introducing and teaching clients how to more efficiently perform their banking needs on ATM’s and the Chase mobile apps. 
Besides working I was able to spend a good amount of time on my break with my family and friends. When Christmas came, we had a family party at my house, which later led to an entire family sleepover. We spent the day together watching movies, cooking, playing games, and various other activities. Then for New Year’s I attended my friends party, consisting of 50 people, and lasted until four in the morning. The weekend before spring semester began I went on a trip to Big Bear with a group of friends from ASA, from various universities in California. Which includes UCLA, UCI, UCSD, UCSF, UCR, and CSUF. I drove out to the University of San Diego and met up with my close friends whom we rented a rental car and drove up to Big Bear. We rented out a 2 story, 5 bedroom cabin sharing it with 20 people. We did various activities such as playing card games, snowboarding, sledding, watching movies, playing billiards, and hanging out. I met many colleagues who were like minded and interesting characters. Overall, this winter break was very successful and enjoyable, making it one of the most memorable experiences.
